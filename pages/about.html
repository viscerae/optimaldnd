        <h2>The team</h2>
        <p>As of today the team is comprised of a single person (Viscera),</p>
        <p>this part of the page will be uploaded later and will feature our top github collaborators.</p>
        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>So, basically I came up with this idea out of nowhere, thinking about it, there aren't many tools</p>
        <p>that help make our DnD sessions more enjoyable for free.</p>
        <p>My plan is essentially to make a platform where you can access anywhere and just start using the tools</p>
        <p>without the need for all those annoying limitations where you need to pay for a subscription in order to</p>
        <p>actually get any use out of them.</p>
        <p>You can get more info on my <a href="https://github.com/Viscerae/optimaldnd">Github</a>.</p>
        <h2>Why I am really doing this</h2>
        <p>There's another reason for starting this project, I always wanted to learn code, so what better way</p>
        <p>than getting hands on and working on a community project along with more experienced people?</p>
        <p>Exactly! So if you have any experience in coding, look at my github and tell me how bad of a job im doing</p>
        <p>but please do correct me and teach me how to improve.</p>
